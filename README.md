# job-search-engine-frontend
Utilizing the JobSpy repository, this is a website where you can search multiple locations for jobs. This is just the frontend, [another repository handles the backend](https://github.com/ebarr10/job-search-engine-backend)


To run:
1. start up back end
run npm run to start the frontend: it will use 127.0.0.1:8000 for the backend unless an .env.local is setup with the variable name REACT_APP_IP_ADDRESS (react requires the REACT_APP_ to be added)
